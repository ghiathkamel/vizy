# vizy

This project provides the software stack for the **Vizy** camera platform.
It includes a web interface, camera control utilities and several example
applications.

## Pixy2 support

Basic Pixy2 camera access is provided via the optional `pixy2` Python
package. Install the package from
[github.com/charmedlabs/pixy2](https://github.com/charmedlabs/pixy2) and
then use ``vizy.Pixy2Camera`` to interact with the sensor.
